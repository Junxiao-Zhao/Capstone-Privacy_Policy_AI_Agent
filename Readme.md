# Capstone Idea

## Intro
In this project, weâ€™d like to develop a chatbot that could help developers generate customized privacy policies for their products following specific Data Protection Regulations.

## Methods
### Stage 1
#### Main Task
1. Collect different data protection regulations, and let **GPT** generate corresponding Privacy Policy templates as **Data Source 1**;
2. For each user input, use GPT to analyze the requirement and match the most suitable template. Then, output a draft privacy policy generated by GPT based on the selected template;
3. Build the chatbot frontend.

#### Parallel Tasks
1. Collect Privacy Policies of those large companies under different regulations as **Data Source 2**;
2. Design the output format.

### Stage 2
#### Main Task
1. Replace GPT with a **Open Source LLM** (Llama 3 70b - Instruct);
2. Try to achieve the same or even better result as Stage 1.

#### Parallel Tasks
1. Collect Privacy Policies of those large companies under different regulations;
2. Further improve the output, by including the reasons for choosing specific templates.

### Stage 3
1. Based on Stage 2, include those privacy policies we collected as few-shot examples:
    - For each user input, use the Open Source LLM to analyze the requirement, and rephrase the requirement to a standard format;
    - Match the most relative existing privacy policies as examples;
    - Select the most suitable template based on the requirement;
    - Providing with the template and examples, let the LLM to generate a customized privacy policy;
