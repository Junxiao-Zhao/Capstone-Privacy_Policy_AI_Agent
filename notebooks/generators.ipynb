Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights\\nof the European Union (‘the Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the\\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right\\nto the protection of personal data concerning him or her.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(2)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard\\nto the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or\\nresidence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their\\nright to the protection of personal data. This Directive is intended to\\ncontribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(3)\\n\\n|\\n\\nRapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges\\nfor the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing\\nof personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows personal data\\nto be processed on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue activities such\\nas the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal\\noffences or the execution of criminal penalties.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(4)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe free flow of personal data between competent authorities for the purposes\\nof the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal\\noffences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding\\nagainst and the prevention of threats to public security within the Union and\\nthe transfer of such personal data to third countries and international\\norganisations, should be facilitated while ensuring a high level of protection\\nof personal data. Those developments require the building of a strong and more\\ncoherent framework for the protection of personal data in the Union, backed by\\nstrong enforcement.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(5)\\n\\n|\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) applies\\nto all processing of personal data in Member States in both the public and the\\nprivate sectors. However, it does not apply to the processing of personal data\\nin the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law,\\nsuch as activities in the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters\\nand police cooperation.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(6)\\n\\n|\\n\\nCouncil Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (4) applies in the areas of judicial\\ncooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. The scope of\\napplication of that Framework Decision is limited to the processing of\\npersonal data transmitted or made available between Member States.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(7)\\n\\n|\\n\\nEnsuring a consistent and high level of protection of the personal data of\\nnatural persons and facilitating the exchange of personal data between\\ncompetent authorities of Members States is crucial in order to ensure\\neffective judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. To\\nthat end, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural\\npersons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent\\nauthorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or\\nprosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,\\nincluding the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public\\nsecurity, should be equivalent in all Member States. Effective protection of\\npersonal data throughout the Union requires the strengthening of the rights of\\ndata subjects and of the obligations of those who process personal data, as\\nwell as equivalent powers for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the\\nrules for the protection of personal data in the Member States.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(8)\\n\\n|\\n\\nArticle 16(2) TFEU mandates the European Parliament and the Council to lay\\ndown the rules relating to the protection of natural person s with regard to\\nthe processing of personal data and the rules relating to the free movement of\\npersonal data.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(9)\\n\\n|\\n\\nOn that basis, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the\\nCouncil (5) lays down general rules to protect natural persons in relation to\\nthe processing of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal\\ndata within the Union.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(10)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn Declaration No 21 on the protection of personal data in the fields of\\njudicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation, annexed to\\nthe final act of the intergovernmental conference which adopted the Treaty of\\nLisbon, the conference acknowledged that specific rules on the protection of\\npersonal data and the free movement of personal data in the fields of judicial\\ncooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation based on Article 16\\nTFEU may prove necessary because of the specific nature of those fields.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(11)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIt is therefore appropriate for those fields to be addressed by a directive\\nthat lays down the specific rules relating to the protection of natural\\npersons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent\\nauthorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or\\nprosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,\\nincluding the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public\\nsecurity, respecting the specific nature of those activities. Such competent\\nauthorities may include not only public authorities such as the judicial\\nauthorities, the police or other law-enforcement authorities but also any\\nother body or entity entrusted by Member State law to exercise public\\nauthority and public powers for the purposes of this Directive. Where such a\\nbody or entity processes personal data for purposes other than for the\\npurposes of this Directive, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 applies. Regulation (EU)\\n2016/679 therefore applies in cases where a body or entity collects personal\\ndata for other purposes and further processes those personal data in order to\\ncomply with a legal obligation to which it is subject. For example, for the\\npurposes of investigation detection or prosecution of criminal offences\\nfinancial institutions retain certain personal data which are processed by\\nthem, and provide those personal data only to the competent national\\nauthorities in specific cases and in accordance with Member State law. A body\\nor entity which processes personal data on behalf of such authorities within\\nthe scope of this Directive should be bound by a contract or other legal act\\nand by the provisions applicable to processors pursuant to this Directive,\\nwhile the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 remains unaffected for the\\nprocessing of personal data by the processor outside the scope of this\\nDirective.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(12)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe activities carried out by the police or other law-enforcement authorities\\nare focused mainly on the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution\\nof criminal offences, including police activities without prior knowledge if\\nan incident is a criminal offence or not. Such activities can also include the\\nexercise of authority by taking coercive measures such as police activities at\\ndemonstrations, major sporting events and riots. They also include maintaining\\nlaw and order as a task conferred on the police or other law-enforcement\\nauthorities where necessary to safeguard against and prevent threats to public\\nsecurity and to fundamental interests of the society protected by law which\\nmay lead to a criminal offence. Member States may entrust competent\\nauthorities with other tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the\\npurposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of\\ncriminal offences, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of\\nthreats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those\\nother purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within\\nthe scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(13)\\n\\n|\\n\\nA criminal offence within the meaning of this Directive should be an\\nautonomous concept of Union law as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the\\nEuropean Union (the ‘Court of Justice’).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(14)\\n\\n|\\n\\nSince this Directive should not apply to the processing of personal data in\\nthe course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Union law,\\nactivities concerning national security, activities of agencies or units\\ndealing with national security issues and the processing of personal data by\\nthe Member States when carrying out activities which fall within the scope of\\nChapter 2 of Title V of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) should not be\\nconsidered to be activities falling within the scope of this Directive.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(15)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to ensure the same level of protection for natural persons through\\nlegally enforceable rights throughout the Union and to prevent divergences\\nhampering the exchange of personal data between competent authorities, this\\nDirective should provide for harmonised rules for the protection and the free\\nmovement of personal data processed for the purposes of the prevention,\\ninvestigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution\\nof criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention\\nof threats to public security. The approximation of Member States' laws should\\nnot result in any lessening of the personal data protection they afford but\\nshould, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection within the\\nUnion. Member States should not be precluded from providing higher safeguards\\nthan those established in this Directive for the protection of the rights and\\nfreedoms of the data subject with regard to the processing of personal data by\\ncompetent authorities.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(16)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the principle of public access to\\nofficial documents. Under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 personal data in official\\ndocuments held by a public authority or a public or private body for the\\nperformance of a task carried out in the public interest may be disclosed by\\nthat authority or body in accordance with Union or Member State law to which\\nthe public authority or body is subject in order to reconcile public access to\\nofficial documents with the right to the protection of personal data.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(17)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe protection afforded by this Directive should apply to natural persons,\\nwhatever their nationality or place of residence, in relation to the\\nprocessing of their personal data.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(18)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to prevent creating a serious risk of circumvention, the protection\\nof natural persons should be technologically neutral and should not depend on\\nthe techniques used. The protection of natural persons should apply to the\\nprocessing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual\\nprocessing, if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained\\nin a filing system. Files or sets of files, as well as their cover pages,\\nwhich are not structured according to specific criteria should not fall within\\nthe scope of this Directive.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(19)\\n\\n|\\n\\nRegulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6)\\napplies to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies,\\noffices and agencies. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and other Union legal acts\\napplicable to such processing of personal data should be adapted to the\\nprinciples and rules established in Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(20)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThis Directive does not preclude Member States from specifying processing\\noperations and processing procedures in national rules on criminal procedures\\nin relation to the processing of personal data by courts and other judicial\\nauthorities, in particular as regards personal data contained in a judicial\\ndecision or in records in relation to criminal proceedings.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(21)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning\\nan identified or identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural\\nperson is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably\\nlikely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by\\nanother person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To\\nascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the\\nnatural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the\\ncosts of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into\\nconsideration the available technology at the time of the processing and\\ntechnological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore\\nnot apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate\\nto an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered\\nanonymous in such a manner that the data subject is no longer identifiable.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(22)\\n\\n|\\n\\nPublic authorities to which personal data are disclosed in accordance with a\\nlegal obligation for the exercise of their official mission, such as tax and\\ncustoms authorities, financial investigation units, independent administrative\\nauthorities, or financial market authorities responsible for the regulation\\nand supervision of securities markets should not be regarded as recipients if\\nthey receive personal data which are necessary to carry out a particular\\ninquiry in the general interest, in accordance with Union or Member State law.\\nThe requests for disclosure sent by the public authorities should always be in\\nwriting, reasoned and occasional and should not concern the entirety of a\\nfiling system or lead to the interconnection of filing systems. The processing\\nof personal data by those public authorities should comply with the applicable\\ndata protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(23)\\n\\n|\\n\\nGenetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or\\nacquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique\\ninformation about the physiology or health of that natural person and which\\nresult from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in\\nquestion, in particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or\\nribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of another element\\nenabling equivalent information to be obtained. Considering the complexity and\\nsensitivity of genetic information, there is a great risk of misuse and re-use\\nfor various purposes by the controller. Any discrimination based on genetic\\nfeatures should in principle be prohibited.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(24)\\n\\n|\\n\\nPersonal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the\\nhealth status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past,\\ncurrent or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This\\nincludes information about the natural person collected in the course of the\\nregistration for, or the provision of, health care services as referred to in\\nDirective 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) to that\\nnatural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to\\nuniquely identify the natural person for health purposes; information derived\\nfrom the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including\\nfrom genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example,\\na disease, disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or\\nthe physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its\\nsource, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital,\\na medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(25)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAll Member States are affiliated to the International Criminal Police\\nOrganisation (Interpol). To fulfil its mission, Interpol receives, stores and\\ncirculates personal data to assist competent authorities in preventing and\\ncombating international crime. It is therefore appropriate to strengthen\\ncooperation between the Union and Interpol by promoting an efficient exchange\\nof personal data whilst ensuring respect for fundamental rights and freedoms\\nregarding the automatic processing of personal data. Where personal data are\\ntransferred from the Union to Interpol, and to countries which have delegated\\nmembers to Interpol, this Directive, in particular the provisions on\\ninternational transfers, should apply. This Directive should be without\\nprejudice to the specific rules laid down in Council Common Position\\n2005/69/JHA (8) and Council Decision 2007/533/JHA (9).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(26)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAny processing of personal data must be lawful, fair and transparent in\\nrelation to the natural persons concerned, and only processed for specific\\npurposes laid down by law. This does not in itself prevent the law-enforcement\\nauthorities from carrying out activities such as covert investigations or\\nvideo surveillance. Such activities can be done for the purposes of the\\nprevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or\\nthe execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and\\nthe prevention of threats to public security, as long as they are laid down by\\nlaw and constitute a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic\\nsociety with due regard for the legitimate interests of the natural person\\nconcerned. The data protection principle of fair processing is a distinct\\nnotion from the right to a fair trial as defined in Article 47 of the Charter\\nand in Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights\\nand Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR). Natural persons should be made aware of\\nrisks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of their\\npersonal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to the processing.\\nIn particular, the specific purposes for which the personal data are processed\\nshould be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection\\nof the personal data. The personal data should be adequate and relevant for\\nthe purposes for which they are processed. It should, in particular, be\\nensured that the personal data collected are not excessive and not kept longer\\nthan is necessary for the purpose for which they are processed. Personal data\\nshould be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably\\nbe fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the data are not kept\\nlonger than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for\\nerasure or for a periodic review. Member States should lay down appropriate\\nsafeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for archiving in the\\npublic interest, scientific, statistical or historical use.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(27)\\n\\n|\\n\\nFor the prevention, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences, it is\\nnecessary for competent authorities to process personal data collected in the\\ncontext of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of specific\\ncriminal offences beyond that context in order to develop an understanding of\\ncriminal activities and to make links between different criminal offences\\ndetected.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(28)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to maintain security in relation to processing and to prevent\\nprocessing in infringement of this Directive, personal data should be\\nprocessed in a manner that ensures an appropriate level of security and\\nconfidentiality, including by preventing unauthorised access to or use of\\npersonal data and the equipment used for the processing, and that takes into\\naccount available state of the art and technology, the costs of implementation\\nin relation to the risks and the nature of the personal data to be protected.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(29)\\n\\n|\\n\\nPersonal data should be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate\\npurposes within the scope of this Directive and should not be processed for\\npurposes incompatible with the purposes of the prevention, investigation,\\ndetection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal\\npenalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to\\npublic security. If personal data are processed by the same or another\\ncontroller for a purpose within the scope of this Directive other than that\\nfor which it has been collected, such processing should be permitted under the\\ncondition that such processing is authorised in accordance with applicable\\nlegal provisions and is necessary for and proportionate to that other purpose.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(30)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe principle of accuracy of data should be applied while taking account of\\nthe nature and purpose of the processing concerned. In particular in judicial\\nproceedings, statements containing personal data are based on the subjective\\nperception of natural persons and are not always verifiable. Consequently, the\\nrequirement of accuracy should not appertain to the accuracy of a statement\\nbut merely to the fact that a specific statement has been made.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(31)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIt is inherent to the processing of personal data in the areas of judicial\\ncooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation that personal data\\nrelating to different categories of data subjects are processed. Therefore, a\\nclear distinction should, where applicable and as far as possible, be made\\nbetween personal data of different categories of data subjects such as:\\nsuspects; persons convicted of a criminal offence; victims and other parties,\\nsuch as witnesses; persons possessing relevant information or contacts; and\\nassociates of suspects and convicted criminals. This should not prevent the\\napplication of the right of presumption of innocence as guaranteed by the\\nCharter and by the ECHR, as interpreted in the case-law of the Court of\\nJustice and by the European Court of Human Rights respectively.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(32)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe competent authorities should ensure that personal data which are\\ninaccurate, incomplete or no longer up to date are not transmitted or made\\navailable. In order to ensure the protection of natural persons, the accuracy,\\ncompleteness or the extent to which the personal data are up to date and the\\nreliability of the personal data transmitted or made available, the competent\\nauthorities should, as far as possible, add necessary information in all\\ntransmissions of personal data.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(33)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere this Directive refers to Member State law, a legal basis or a\\nlegislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act\\nadopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the\\nconstitutional order of the Member State concerned. However, such a Member\\nState law, legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and\\nits application foreseeable for those subject to it, as required by the case-\\nlaw of the Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights. Member\\nState law regulating the processing of personal data within the scope of this\\nDirective should specify at least the objectives, the personal data to be\\nprocessed, the purposes of the processing and procedures for preserving the\\nintegrity and confidentiality of personal data and procedures for its\\ndestruction, thus providing sufficient guarantees against the risk of abuse\\nand arbitrariness.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(34)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of\\nthe prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences\\nor the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and\\nthe prevention of threats to public security, should cover any operation or\\nset of operations which are performed upon personal data or sets of personal\\ndata for those purposes, whether by automated means or otherwise, such as\\ncollection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or\\nalteration, retrieval, consultation, use, alignment or combination,\\nrestriction of processing, erasure or destruction. In particular, the rules of\\nthis Directive should apply to the transmission of personal data for the\\npurposes of this Directive to a recipient not subject to this Directive. Such\\na recipient should encompass a natural or legal person, public authority,\\nagency or any other body to which personal data are lawfully disclosed by the\\ncompetent authority. Where personal data were initially collected by a\\ncompetent authority for one of the purposes of this Directive, Regulation (EU)\\n2016/679 should apply to the processing of those data for purposes other than\\nthe purposes of this Directive where such processing is authorised by Union or\\nMember State law. In particular, the rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should\\napply to the transmission of personal data for purposes outside the scope of\\nthis Directive. For the processing of personal data by a recipient that is not\\na competent authority or that is not acting as such within the meaning of this\\nDirective and to which personal data are lawfully disclosed by a competent\\nauthority, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 should apply. While implementing this\\nDirective, Member States should also be able to further specify the\\napplication of the rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, subject to the\\nconditions set out therein.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(35)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to be lawful, the processing of personal data under this Directive\\nshould be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public\\ninterest by a competent authority based on Union or Member State law for the\\npurposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of\\ncriminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the\\nsafeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security. Those\\nactivities should cover the protection of vital interests of the data subject.\\nThe performance of the tasks of preventing, investigating, detecting or\\nprosecuting criminal offences institutionally conferred by law to the\\ncompetent authorities allows them to require or order natural persons to\\ncomply with requests made. In such a case, the consent of the data subject, as\\ndefined in Regulation (EU) 2016/679, should not provide a legal ground for\\nprocessing personal data by competent authorities. Where the data subject is\\nrequired to comply with a legal obligation, the data subject has no genuine\\nand free choice, so that the reaction of the data subject could not be\\nconsidered to be a freely given indication of his or her wishes. This should\\nnot preclude Member States from providing, by law, that the data subject may\\nagree to the processing of his or her personal data for the purposes of this\\nDirective, such as DNA tests in criminal investigations or the monitoring of\\nhis or her location with electronic tags for the execution of criminal\\npenalties.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(36)\\n\\n|\\n\\nMember States should provide that where Union or Member State law applicable\\nto the transmitting competent authority provides for specific conditions\\napplicable in specific circumstances to the processing of personal data, such\\nas the use of handling codes, the transmitting competent authority should\\ninform the recipient of such personal data of those conditions and the\\nrequirement to respect them. Such conditions could, for example, include a\\nprohibition against transmitting the personal data further to others, or using\\nthem for purposes other than those for which they were transmitted to the\\nrecipient, or informing the data subject in the case of a limitation of the\\nright of information without the prior approval of the transmitting competent\\nauthority. Those obligations should also apply to transfers by the\\ntransmitting competent authority to recipients in third countries or\\ninternational organisations. Member States should ensure that the transmitting\\ncompetent authority does not apply such conditions to recipients in other\\nMember States or to agencies, offices and bodies established pursuant to\\nChapters 4 and 5 of Title V of the TFEU other than those applicable to similar\\ndata transmissions within the Member State of that competent authority.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(37)\\n\\n|\\n\\nPersonal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation\\nto fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of\\ntheir processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and\\nfreedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or\\nethnic origin, whereby the use of the term ‘racial origin’ in this Directive\\ndoes not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to\\ndetermine the existence of separate human races. Such personal data should not\\nbe processed, unless processing is subject to appropriate safeguards for the\\nrights and freedoms of the data subject laid down by law and is allowed in\\ncases authorised by law; where not already authorised by such a law, the\\nprocessing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or\\nof another person; or the processing relates to data which are manifestly made\\npublic by the data subject. Appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms\\nof the data subject could include the possibility to collect those data only\\nin connection with other data on the natural person concerned, the possibility\\nto secure the data collected adequately, stricter rules on the access of staff\\nof the competent authority to the data and the prohibition of transmission of\\nthose data. The processing of such data should also be allowed by law where\\nthe data subject has explicitly agreed to the processing that is particularly\\nintrusive to him or her. However, the consent of the data subject should not\\nprovide in itself a legal ground for processing such sensitive personal data\\nby competent authorities.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(38)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision\\nevaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on\\nautomated processing and which produces adverse legal effects concerning, or\\nsignificantly affects, him or her. In any case, such processing should be\\nsubject to suitable safeguards, including the provision of specific\\ninformation to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, in\\nparticular to express his or her point of view, to obtain an explanation of\\nthe decision reached after such assessment or to challenge the decision.\\nProfiling that results in discrimination against natural persons on the basis\\nof personal data which are by their nature particularly sensitive in relation\\nto fundamental rights and freedoms should be prohibited under the conditions\\nlaid down in Articles 21 and 52 of the Charter.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(39)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to enable him or her to exercise his or her rights, any information\\nto the data subject should be easily accessible, including on the website of\\nthe controller, and easy to understand, using clear and plain language. Such\\ninformation should be adapted to the needs of vulnerable persons such as\\nchildren.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(40)\\n\\n|\\n\\nModalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data\\nsubject's rights under the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive,\\nincluding mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in\\nparticular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and\\nrestriction of processing. The controller should be obliged to respond to\\nrequests of the data subject without undue delay, unless the controller\\napplies limitations to data subject rights in accordance with this Directive.\\nMoreover, if requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, such as where the\\ndata subject unreasonably and repetitiously requests information or where the\\ndata subject abuses his or her right to receive information, for example, by\\nproviding false or misleading information when making the request, the\\ncontroller should be able to charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the\\nrequest.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(41)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere the controller requests the provision of additional information\\nnecessary to confirm the identity of the data subject, that information should\\nbe processed only for that specific purpose and should not be stored for\\nlonger than needed for that purpose.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(42)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAt least the following information should be made available to the data\\nsubject: the identity of the controller, the existence of the processing\\noperation, the purposes of the processing, the right to lodge a complaint and\\nthe existence of the right to request from the controller access to and\\nrectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing. This\\ncould take place on the website of the competent authority. In addition, in\\nspecific cases and in order to enable the exercise of his or her rights, the\\ndata subject should be informed of the legal basis for the processing and of\\nhow long the data will be stored, in so far as such further information is\\nnecessary, taking into account the specific circumstances in which the data\\nare processed, to guarantee fair processing in respect of the data subject.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(43)\\n\\n|\\n\\nA natural person should have the right of access to data which has been\\ncollected concerning him or her, and to exercise this right easily and at\\nreasonable intervals, in order to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the\\nprocessing. Every data subject should therefore have the right to know, and\\nobtain communications about, the purposes for which the data are processed,\\nthe period during which the data are processed and the recipients of the data,\\nincluding those in third countries. Where such communications include\\ninformation as to the origin of the personal data, the information should not\\nreveal the identity of natural persons, in particular confidential sources.\\nFor that right to be complied with, it is sufficient that the data subject be\\nin possession of a full summary of those data in an intelligible form, that is\\nto say a form which allows that data subject to become aware of those data and\\nto verify that they are accurate and processed in accordance with this\\nDirective, so that it is possible for him or her to exercise the rights\\nconferred on him or her by this Directive. Such a summary could be provided in\\nthe form of a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(44)\\n\\n|\\n\\nMember States should be able to adopt legislative measures delaying,\\nrestricting or omitting the information to data subjects or restricting,\\nwholly or partly, the access to their personal data to the extent that and as\\nlong as such a measure constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a\\ndemocratic society with due regard for the fundamental rights and the\\nlegitimate interests of the natural person concerned, to avoid obstructing\\nofficial or legal inquiries, investigations or procedures, to avoid\\nprejudicing the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of\\ncriminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, to protect public\\nsecurity or national security, or to protect the rights and freedoms of\\nothers. The controller should assess, by way of a concrete and individual\\nexamination of each case, whether the right of access should be partially or\\ncompletely restricted.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(45)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAny refusal or restriction of access should in principle be set out in writing\\nto the data subject and include the factual or legal reasons on which the\\ndecision is based.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(46)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAny restriction of the rights of the data subject must comply with the Charter\\nand with the ECHR, as interpreted in the case-law of the Court of Justice and\\nby the European Court of Human Rights respectively, and in particular respect\\nthe essence of those rights and freedoms.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(47)\\n\\n|\\n\\nA natural person should have the right to have inaccurate personal data\\nconcerning him or her rectified, in particular where it relates to facts, and\\nthe right to erasure where the processing of such data infringes this\\nDirective. However, the right to rectification should not affect, for example,\\nthe content of a witness testimony. A natural person should also have the\\nright to restriction of processing where he or she contests the accuracy of\\npersonal data and its accuracy or inaccuracy cannot be ascertained or where\\nthe personal data have to be maintained for purpose of evidence. In\\nparticular, instead of erasing personal data, processing should be restricted\\nif in a specific case there are reasonable grounds to believe that erasure\\ncould affect the legitimate interests of the data subject. In such a case,\\nrestricted data should be processed only for the purpose which prevented their\\nerasure. Methods to restrict the processing of personal data could include,\\ninter alia, moving the selected data to another processing system, for example\\nfor archiving purposes, or making the selected data unavailable. In automated\\nfiling systems the restriction of processing should in principle be ensured by\\ntechnical means. The fact that the processing of personal data is restricted\\nshould be indicated in the system in such a manner that it is clear that the\\nprocessing of the personal data is restricted. Such rectification or erasure\\nof personal data or restriction of processing should be communicated to\\nrecipients to whom the data have been disclosed and to the competent\\nauthorities from which the inaccurate data originated. The controllers should\\nalso abstain from further dissemination of such data.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(48)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere the controller denies a data subject his or her right to information,\\naccess to or rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of\\nprocessing, the data subject should have the right to request that the\\nnational supervisory authority verify the lawfulness of the processing. The\\ndata subject should be informed of that right. Where the supervisory authority\\nacts on behalf of the data subject, the data subject should be informed by the\\nsupervisory authority at least that all necessary verifications or reviews by\\nthe supervisory authority have taken place. The supervisory authority should\\nalso inform the data subject of the right to seek a judicial remedy.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(49)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere the personal data are processed in the course of a criminal\\ninvestigation and court proceedings in criminal matters, Member States should\\nbe able to provide that the exercise the right to information, access to and\\nrectification or erasure of personal data and restriction of processing is\\ncarried out in accordance with national rules on judicial proceedings.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(50)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing of\\npersonal data carried out by the controller or on the controller's behalf\\nshould be established. In particular, the controller should be obliged to\\nimplement appropriate and effective measures and should be able to demonstrate\\nthat processing activities are in compliance with this Directive. Such\\nmeasures should take into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of\\nthe processing and the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. The\\nmeasures taken by the controller should include drawing up and implementing\\nspecific safeguards in respect of the treatment of personal data of vulnerable\\nnatural persons, such as children.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(51)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, of varying likelihood\\nand severity, may result from data processing which could lead to physical,\\nmaterial or non-material damage, in particular: where the processing may give\\nrise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, damage to the\\nreputation, loss of confidentiality of data protected by professional secrecy,\\nunauthorised reversal of pseudonymisation or any other significant economic or\\nsocial disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their rights and\\nfreedoms or from exercising control over their personal data; where personal\\ndata are processed which reveal racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,\\nreligion or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership; where genetic\\ndata or biometric data are processed in order to uniquely identify a person or\\nwhere data concerning health or data concerning sex life and sexual\\norientation or criminal convictions and offences or related security measures\\nare processed; where personal aspects are evaluated, in particular analysing\\nand predicting aspects concerning performance at work, economic situation,\\nhealth, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behaviour, location\\nor movements, in order to create or use personal profiles; where personal data\\nof vulnerable natural persons, in particular children, are processed; or where\\nprocessing involves a large amount of personal data and affects a large number\\nof data subjects.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(52)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe likelihood and severity of the risk should be determined by reference to\\nthe nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing. Risk should be\\nevaluated on the basis of an objective assessment, through which it is\\nestablished whether data-processing operations involve a high risk. A high\\nrisk is a particular risk of prejudice to the rights and freedoms of data\\nsubjects.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(53)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to\\nthe processing of personal data requires that appropriate technical and\\norganisational measures are taken, to ensure that the requirements of this\\nDirective are met. The implementation of such measures should not depend\\nsolely on economic considerations. In order to be able to demonstrate\\ncompliance with this Directive, the controller should adopt internal policies\\nand implement measures which adhere in particular to the principles of data\\nprotection by design and data protection by default. Where the controller has\\ncarried out a data protection impact assessment pursuant to this Directive,\\nthe results should be taken into account when developing those measures and\\nprocedures. The measures could consist, inter alia, of the use of\\npseudonymisation, as early as possible. The use of pseudonymisation for the\\npurposes of this Directive can serve as a tool that could facilitate, in\\nparticular, the free flow of personal data within the area of freedom,\\nsecurity and justice.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(54)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe protection of the rights and freedoms of data subjects as well as the\\nresponsibility and liability of controllers and processors, also in relation\\nto the monitoring by and measures of supervisory authorities, requires a clear\\nattribution of the responsibilities set out in this Directive, including where\\na controller determines the purposes and means of the processing jointly with\\nother controllers or where a processing operation is carried out on behalf of\\na controller.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(55)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe carrying-out of processing by a processor should be governed by a legal\\nact including a contract binding the processor to the controller and\\nstipulating, in particular, that the processor should act only on instructions\\nfrom the controller. The processor should take into account the principle of\\ndata protection by design and by default.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(56)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to demonstrate compliance with this Directive, the controller or\\nprocessor should maintain records regarding all categories of processing\\nactivities under its responsibility. Each controller and processor should be\\nobliged to cooperate with the supervisory authority and make those records\\navailable to it on request, so that they might serve for monitoring those\\nprocessing operations. The controller or the processor processing personal\\ndata in non-automated processing systems should have in place effective\\nmethods of demonstrating the lawfulness of the processing, of enabling self-\\nmonitoring and of ensuring data integrity and data security, such as logs or\\nother forms of records.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(57)\\n\\n|\\n\\nLogs should be kept at least for operations in automated processing systems\\nsuch as collection, alteration, consultation, disclosure including transfers,\\ncombination or erasure. The identification of the person who consulted or\\ndisclosed personal data should be logged and from that identification it\\nshould be possible to establish the justification for the processing\\noperations. The logs should solely be used for the verification of the\\nlawfulness of the processing, self-monitoring, for ensuring data integrity and\\ndata security and criminal proceedings. Self-monitoring also includes internal\\ndisciplinary proceedings of competent authorities.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(58)\\n\\n|\\n\\nA data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller\\nwhere the processing operations are likely to result in a high risk to the\\nrights and freedoms of data subjects by virtue of their nature, scope or\\npurposes, which should include, in particular, the measures, safeguards and\\nmechanisms envisaged to ensure the protection of personal data and to\\ndemonstrate compliance with this Directive. Impact assessments should cover\\nrelevant systems and processes of processing operations, but not individual\\ncases.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(59)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to ensure effective protection of the rights and freedoms of data\\nsubjects, the controller or processor should consult the supervisory\\nauthority, in certain cases, prior to the processing.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(60)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to maintain security and to prevent processing that infringes this\\nDirective, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in\\nthe processing and should implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as\\nencryption. Such measures should ensure an appropriate level of security,\\nincluding confidentiality and take into account the state of the art, the\\ncosts of implementation in relation to the risk and the nature of the personal\\ndata to be protected. In assessing data security risks, consideration should\\nbe given to the risks that are presented by data processing, such as the\\naccidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorised\\ndisclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise\\nprocessed, which may, in particular, lead to physical, material or non-\\nmaterial damage. The controller and processor should ensure that the\\nprocessing of personal data is not carried out by unauthorised persons.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(61)\\n\\n|\\n\\nA personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely\\nmanner, result in physical, material or non-material damage to natural persons\\nsuch as loss of control over their personal data or limitation of their\\nrights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial loss, unauthorised\\nreversal of pseudonymisation, damage to reputation, loss of confidentiality of\\npersonal data protected by professional secrecy or any other significant\\neconomic or social disadvantage to the natural person concerned. Therefore, as\\nsoon as the controller becomes aware that a personal data breach has occurred,\\nthe controller should notify the personal data breach to the supervisory\\nauthority without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours\\nafter having become aware of it, unless the controller is able to demonstrate,\\nin accordance with the accountability principle, that the personal data breach\\nis unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\\nWhere such notification cannot be achieved within 72 hours, the reasons for\\nthe delay should accompany the notification and information may be provided in\\nphases without undue further delay.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(62)\\n\\n|\\n\\nNatural persons should be informed without undue delay where the personal data\\nbreach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of\\nnatural persons, in order to allow them to take the necessary precautions. The\\ncommunication should describe the nature of the personal data breach and\\ninclude recommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential\\nadverse effects. Communication to data subjects should be made as soon as\\nreasonably feasible, in close cooperation with the supervisory authority, and\\nrespecting guidance provided by it or other relevant authorities. For example,\\nthe need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would call for a prompt\\ncommunication to data subjects, whereas the need to implement appropriate\\nmeasures against continuing or similar data breaches may justify more time for\\nthe communication. Where avoiding obstruction of official or legal inquiries,\\ninvestigations or procedures, avoiding prejudice to the prevention, detection,\\ninvestigation or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal\\npenalties, protecting public security, protecting national security or\\nprotecting the rights and freedoms of others cannot be achieved by delaying or\\nrestricting the communication of a personal data breach to the natural person\\nconcerned, such communication could, in exceptional circumstances, be omitted.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(63)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe controller should designate a person who would assist it in monitoring\\ninternal compliance with the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive,\\nexcept where a Member State decides to exempt courts and other independent\\njudicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity. That person could\\nbe a member of the existing staff of the controller who received special\\ntraining in data protection law and practice in order to acquire expert\\nknowledge in that field. The necessary level of expert knowledge should be\\ndetermined, in particular, according to the data processing carried out and\\nthe protection required for the personal data processed by the controller. His\\nor her task could be carried out on a part-time or full-time basis. A data\\nprotection officer may be appointed jointly by several controllers, taking\\ninto account their organisational structure and size, for example in the case\\nof shared resources in central units. That person can also be appointed to\\ndifferent positions within the structure of the relevant controllers. That\\nperson should help the controller and the employees processing personal data\\nby informing and advising them on compliance with their relevant data\\nprotection obligations. Such data protection officers should be in a position\\nto perform their duties and tasks in an independent manner in accordance with\\nMember State law.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(64)\\n\\n|\\n\\nMember States should ensure that a transfer to a third country or to an\\ninternational organisation takes place only if necessary for the prevention,\\ninvestigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution\\nof criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention\\nof threats to public security, and that the controller in the third country or\\ninternational organisation is an authority competent within the meaning of\\nthis Directive. A transfer should be carried out only by competent authorities\\nacting as controllers, except where processors are explicitly instructed to\\ntransfer on behalf of controllers. Such a transfer may take place in cases\\nwhere the Commission has decided that the third country or international\\norganisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection, where\\nappropriate safeguards have been provided, or where derogations for specific\\nsituations apply. Where personal data are transferred from the Union to\\ncontrollers, to processors or to other recipients in third countries or\\ninternational organisations, the level of protection of natural persons\\nprovided for in the Union by this Directive should not be undermined,\\nincluding in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country\\nor international organisation to controllers or processors in the same or in\\nanother third country or international organisation.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(65)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere personal data are transferred from a Member State to third countries or\\ninternational organisations, such a transfer should, in principle, take place\\nonly after the Member State from which the data were obtained has given its\\nauthorisation to the transfer. The interests of efficient law-enforcement\\ncooperation require that where the nature of a threat to the public security\\nof a Member State or a third country or to the essential interests of a Member\\nState is so immediate as to render it impossible to obtain prior authorisation\\nin good time, the competent authority should be able to transfer the relevant\\npersonal data to the third country or international organisation concerned\\nwithout such a prior authorisation. Member States should provide that any\\nspecific conditions concerning the transfer should be communicated to third\\ncountries or international organisations. Onward transfers of personal data\\nshould be subject to prior authorisation by the competent authority that\\ncarried out the original transfer. When deciding on a request for the\\nauthorisation of an onward transfer, the competent authority that carried out\\nthe original transfer should take due account of all relevant factors,\\nincluding the seriousness of the criminal offence, the specific conditions\\nsubject to which, and the purpose for which, the data was originally\\ntransferred, the nature and conditions of the execution of the criminal\\npenalty, and the level of personal data protection in the third country or an\\ninternational organisation to which personal data are onward transferred. The\\ncompetent authority that carried out the original transfer should also be able\\nto subject the onward transfer to specific conditions. Such specific\\nconditions can be described, for example, in handling codes.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(66)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe Commission should be able to decide with effect for the entire Union that\\ncertain third countries, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a\\nthird country, or an international organisation, offer an adequate level of\\ndata protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the\\nUnion as regards the third countries or international organisations which are\\nconsidered to provide such a level of protection. In such cases, transfers of\\npersonal data to those countries should be able to take place without the need\\nto obtain any specific authorisation, except where another Member State from\\nwhich the data were obtained has to give its authorisation to the transfer.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(67)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in\\nparticular the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its\\nassessment of the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within\\na third country, take into account how a particular third country respects the\\nrule of law, access to justice as well as international human rights norms and\\nstandards and its general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning\\npublic security, defence and national security, as well as public order and\\ncriminal law. The adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory\\nor a specified sector in a third country should take into account clear and\\nobjective criteria, such as specific processing activities and the scope of\\napplicable legal standards and legislation in force in the third country. The\\nthird country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection\\nessentially equivalent to that ensured within the Union, in particular where\\ndata are processed in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the\\nthird country should ensure effective independent data protection supervision\\nand provide for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection\\nauthorities, and the data subjects should be provided with effective and\\nenforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(68)\\n\\n|\\n\\nApart from the international commitments the third country or international\\norganisation has entered into, the Commission should also take account of\\nobligations arising from the third country's or international organisation's\\nparticipation in multilateral or regional systems, in particular in relation\\nto the protection of personal data, as well as the implementation of such\\nobligations. In particular the third country's accession to the Council of\\nEurope Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with\\nregard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data and its Additional\\nProtocol should be taken into account. The Commission should consult with the\\nEuropean Data Protection Board established by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the\\n‘Board’) when assessing the level of protection in third countries or\\ninternational organisations. The Commission should also take into account any\\nrelevant Commission adequacy decision adopted in accordance with Article 45 of\\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(69)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of\\nprotection in a third country, a territory or a specified sector within a\\nthird country, or an international organisation. In its adequacy decisions,\\nthe Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their\\nfunctioning. That periodic review should be undertaken in consultation with\\nthe third country or international organisation in question and should take\\ninto account all relevant developments in the third country or international\\norganisation.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(70)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe Commission should also be able to recognise that a third country, a\\nterritory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international\\norganisation, no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection.\\nConsequently, the transfer of personal data to that third country or\\ninternational organisation should be prohibited unless the requirements in\\nthis Directive relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards and\\nderogations for specific situations are fulfilled. Provision should be made\\nfor procedures for consultations between the Commission and such third\\ncountries or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely\\nmanner, inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons\\nand enter into consultations with it in order to remedy the situation.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(71)\\n\\n|\\n\\nTransfers not based on such an adequacy decision should be allowed only where\\nappropriate safeguards have been provided in a legally binding instrument\\nwhich ensures the protection of personal data or where the controller has\\nassessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and, on the basis\\nof that assessment, considers that appropriate safeguards with regard to the\\nprotection of personal data exist. Such legally binding instruments could, for\\nexample, be legally binding bilateral agreements which have been concluded by\\nthe Member States and implemented in their legal order and which could be\\nenforced by their data subjects, ensuring compliance with data protection\\nrequirements and the rights of the data subjects, including the right to\\nobtain effective administrative or judicial redress. The controller should be\\nable to take into account cooperation agreements concluded between Europol or\\nEurojust and third countries which allow for the exchange of personal data\\nwhen carrying out the assessment of all the circumstances surrounding the data\\ntransfer. The controller should be able to also take into account the fact\\nthat the transfer of personal data will be subject to confidentiality\\nobligations and the principle of specificity, ensuring that the data will not\\nbe processed for other purposes than for the purposes of the transfer. In\\naddition, the controller should take into account that the personal data will\\nnot be used to request, hand down or execute a death penalty or any form of\\ncruel and inhuman treatment. While those conditions could be considered to be\\nappropriate safeguards allowing the transfer of data, the controller should be\\nable to require additional safeguards.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(72)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere no adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards exist, a transfer or a\\ncategory of transfers could take place only in specific situations, if\\nnecessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another\\nperson, or to safeguard legitimate interests of the data subject where the law\\nof the Member State transferring the personal data so provides; for the\\nprevention of an immediate and serious threat to the public security of a\\nMember State or a third country; in an individual case for the purposes of the\\nprevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or\\nthe execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and\\nthe prevention of threats to public security; or in an individual case for the\\nestablishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. Those derogations should\\nbe interpreted restrictively and should not allow frequent, massive and\\nstructural transfers of personal data, or large-scale transfers of data, but\\nshould be limited to data strictly necessary. Such transfers should be\\ndocumented and should be made available to the supervisory authority on\\nrequest in order to monitor the lawfulness of the transfer.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(73)\\n\\n|\\n\\nCompetent authorities of Member States apply bilateral or multilateral\\ninternational agreements in force, concluded with third countries in the field\\nof judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation, for the\\nexchange of relevant information to allow them to perform their legally\\nassigned tasks. In principle, this takes place through, or at least with, the\\ncooperation of the authorities competent in the third countries concerned for\\nthe purposes of this Directive, sometimes even in the absence of a bilateral\\nor multilateral international agreement. However, in specific individual\\ncases, the regular procedures requiring contacting such an authority in the\\nthird country may be ineffective or inappropriate, in particular because the\\ntransfer could not be carried out in a timely manner, or because that\\nauthority in the third country does not respect the rule of law or\\ninternational human rights norms and standards, so that competent authorities\\nof Member States could decide to transfer personal data directly to recipients\\nestablished in those third countries. This may be the case where there is an\\nurgent need to transfer personal data to save the life of a person who is in\\ndanger of becoming a victim of a criminal offence or in the interest of\\npreventing an imminent perpetration of a crime, including terrorism. Even if\\nsuch a transfer between competent authorities and recipients established in\\nthird countries should take place only in specific individual cases, this\\nDirective should provide for conditions to regulate such cases. Those\\nprovisions should not be considered to be derogations from any existing\\nbilateral or multilateral international agreements in the field of judicial\\ncooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. Those rules should\\napply in addition to the other rules of this Directive, in particular those on\\nthe lawfulness of processing and Chapter V.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(74)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere personal data move across borders it may put at increased risk the\\nability of natural persons to exercise data protection rights to protect\\nthemselves from the unlawful use or disclosure of those data. At the same\\ntime, supervisory authorities may find that they are unable to pursue\\ncomplaints or conduct investigations relating to the activities outside their\\nborders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border context may also\\nbe hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers and inconsistent\\nlegal regimes. Therefore, there is a need to promote closer cooperation among\\ndata protection supervisory authorities to help them exchange information with\\ntheir foreign counterparts.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(75)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe establishment in Member States of supervisory authorities that are able to\\nexercise their functions with complete independence is an essential component\\nof the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their\\npersonal data. The supervisory authorities should monitor the application of\\nthe provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and should contribute to\\ntheir consistent application throughout the Union in order to protect natural\\npersons with regard to the processing of their personal data. To that end, the\\nsupervisory authorities should cooperate with each other and with the\\nCommission.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(76)\\n\\n|\\n\\nMember States may entrust a supervisory authority already established under\\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 with the responsibility for the tasks to be performed\\nby the national supervisory authorities to be established under this\\nDirective.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(77)\\n\\n|\\n\\nMember States should be allowed to establish more than one supervisory\\nauthority to reflect their constitutional, organisational and administrative\\nstructure. Each supervisory authority should be provided with the financial\\nand human resources, premises and infrastructure, which are necessary for the\\neffective performance of their tasks, including for the tasks related to\\nmutual assistance and cooperation with other supervisory authorities\\nthroughout the Union. Each supervisory authority should have a separate,\\npublic annual budget, which may be part of the overall state or national\\nbudget.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(78)\\n\\n|\\n\\nSupervisory authorities should be subject to independent control or monitoring\\nmechanisms regarding their financial expenditure, provided that such financial\\ncontrol does not affect their independence.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(79)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe general conditions for the member or members of the supervisory authority\\nshould be laid down by Member State law and should in particular provide that\\nthose members should be either appointed by the parliament or the government\\nor the head of State of the Member State based on a proposal from the\\ngovernment or a member of the government, or the parliament or its chamber, or\\nby an independent body entrusted by Member State law with the appointment by\\nmeans of a transparent procedure. In order to ensure the independence of the\\nsupervisory authority, the member or members should act with integrity, should\\nrefrain from any action incompatible with their duties and should not, during\\ntheir term of office, engage in any incompatible occupation, whether gainful\\nor not. In order to ensure the independence of the supervisory authority, the\\nstaff should be chosen by the supervisory authority which may include an\\nintervention by an independent body entrusted by Member State law.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(80)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhile this Directive applies also to the activities of national courts and\\nother judicial authorities, the competence of the supervisory authorities\\nshould not cover the processing of personal data where courts are acting in\\ntheir judicial capacity, in order to safeguard the independence of judges in\\nthe performance of their judicial tasks. That exemption should be limited to\\njudicial activities in court cases and not apply to other activities where\\njudges might be involved in accordance with Member State law. Member States\\nshould also be able to provide that the competence of the supervisory\\nauthority does not cover the processing of personal data of other independent\\njudicial authorities when acting in their judicial capacity, for example\\npublic prosecutor's office. In any event, the compliance with the rules of\\nthis Directive by the courts and other independent judicial authorities is\\nalways subject to independent supervision in accordance with Article 8(3) of\\nthe Charter.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(81)\\n\\n|\\n\\nEach supervisory authority should handle complaints lodged by any data subject\\nand should investigate the matter or transmit it to the competent supervisory\\nauthority. The investigation following a complaint should be carried out,\\nsubject to judicial review, to the extent that is appropriate in the specific\\ncase. The supervisory authority should inform the data subject of the progress\\nand the outcome of the complaint within a reasonable period. If the case\\nrequires further investigation or coordination with another supervisory\\nauthority, intermediate information should be provided to the data subject.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(82)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to ensure effective, reliable and consistent monitoring of compliance\\nwith and enforcement of this Directive throughout the Union pursuant to the\\nTFEU as interpreted by the Court of Justice, the supervisory authorities\\nshould have in each Member State the same tasks and effective powers,\\nincluding investigative, corrective, and advisory powers which constitute\\nnecessary means to perform their tasks. However, their powers should not\\ninterfere with specific rules for criminal proceedings, including\\ninvestigation and prosecution of criminal offences, or the independence of the\\njudiciary. Without prejudice to the powers of prosecutorial authorities under\\nMember State law, supervisory authorities should also have the power to bring\\ninfringements of this Directive to the attention of the judicial authorities\\nor to engage in legal proceedings. The powers of supervisory authorities\\nshould be exercised in accordance with appropriate procedural safeguards laid\\ndown by Union and Member State law, impartially, fairly and within a\\nreasonable time. In particular each measure should be appropriate, necessary\\nand proportionate in view of ensuring compliance with this Directive, taking\\ninto account the circumstances of each individual case, respect the right of\\nevery person to be heard before any individual measure that would adversely\\naffect the person concerned is taken, and avoiding superfluous costs and\\nexcessive inconvenience to the person concerned. Investigative powers as\\nregards access to premises should be exercised in accordance with specific\\nrequirements in Member State law, such as the requirement to obtain a prior\\njudicial authorisation. The adoption of a legally binding decision should be\\nsubject to judicial review in the Member State of the supervisory authority\\nthat adopted the decision.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(83)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe supervisory authorities should assist one another in performing their\\ntasks and provide mutual assistance, so as to ensure the consistent\\napplication and enforcement of the provisions adopted pursuant to this\\nDirective.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(84)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe Board should contribute to the consistent application of this Directive\\nthroughout the Union, including advising the Commission and promoting the\\ncooperation of the supervisory authorities throughout the Union.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(85)\\n\\n|\\n\\nEvery data subject should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single\\nsupervisory authority and to an effective judicial remedy in accordance with\\nArticle 47 of the Charter where the data subject considers that his or her\\nrights under provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive are infringed or\\nwhere the supervisory authority does not act on a complaint, partially or\\nwholly rejects or dismisses a complaint or does not act where such action is\\nnecessary to protect the rights of the data subject. The investigation\\nfollowing a complaint should be carried out, subject to judicial review, to\\nthe extent that is appropriate in the specific case. The competent supervisory\\nauthority should inform the data subject of the progress and the outcome of\\nthe complaint within a reasonable period. If the case requires further\\ninvestigation or coordination with another supervisory authority, intermediate\\ninformation should be provided to the data subject. In order to facilitate the\\nsubmission of complaints, each supervisory authority should take measures such\\nas providing a complaint submission form which can also be completed\\nelectronically, without excluding other means of communication.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(86)\\n\\n|\\n\\nEach natural or legal person should have the right to an effective judicial\\nremedy before the competent national court against a decision of a supervisory\\nauthority which produces legal effects concerning that person. Such a decision\\nconcerns in particular the exercise of investigative, corrective and\\nauthorisation powers by the supervisory authority or the dismissal or\\nrejection of complaints. However, that right does not encompass other measures\\nof supervisory authorities which are not legally binding, such as opinions\\nissued by or advice provided by the supervisory authority. Proceedings against\\na supervisory authority should be brought before the courts of the Member\\nState where the supervisory authority is established and should be conducted\\nin accordance with Member State law. Those courts should exercise full\\njurisdiction which should include jurisdiction to examine all questions of\\nfact and law relevant to the dispute before it.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(87)\\n\\n|\\n\\nWhere a data subject considers that his or her rights under this Directive are\\ninfringed, he or she should have the right to mandate a body which aims to\\nprotect the rights and interests of data subjects in relation to the\\nprotection of their personal data and is constituted according to Member State\\nlaw to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with a supervisory authority and\\nto exercise the right to a judicial remedy. The right of representation of\\ndata subjects should be without prejudice to Member State procedural law which\\nmay require mandatory representation of data subjects by a lawyer, as defined\\nin Council Directive 77/249/EEC (10), before national courts.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(88)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAny damage which a person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes\\nthe provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive should be compensated by the\\ncontroller or any other authority competent under Member State law. The\\nconcept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case-law\\nof the Court of Justice in a manner which fully reflects the objectives of\\nthis Directive. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage deriving\\nfrom the violation of other rules in Union or Member State law. When reference\\nis made to processing that is unlawful or that infringes the provisions\\nadopted pursuant to this Directive it also covers processing that infringes\\nimplementing acts adopted pursuant to this Directive. Data subjects should\\nreceive full and effective compensation for the damage that they have\\nsuffered.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(89)\\n\\n|\\n\\nPenalties should be imposed on any natural or legal person, whether governed\\nby private or public law, who infringes this Directive. Member States should\\nensure that the penalties are effective, proportionate and dissuasive and\\nshould take all measures to implement the penalties.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(90)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this\\nDirective, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission with\\nregard to the adequate level of protection afforded by a third country, a\\nterritory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international\\norganisation and the format and procedures for mutual assistance and the\\narrangements for the exchange of information by electronic means between\\nsupervisory authorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board.\\nThose powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No\\n182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(91)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe examination procedure should be used for the adoption of implementing acts\\non the adequate level of protection afforded by a third country, a territory\\nor a specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation\\nand on the format and procedures for mutual assistance and the arrangements\\nfor the exchange of information by electronic means between supervisory\\nauthorities, and between supervisory authorities and the Board, given that\\nthose acts are of a general scope.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(92)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in\\nduly justified cases relating to a third country, a territory or a specified\\nsector within a third country, or an international organisation which no\\nlonger ensure an adequate level of protection, imperative grounds of urgency\\nso require.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(93)\\n\\n|\\n\\nSince the objectives of this Directive, namely to protect the fundamental\\nrights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the\\nprotection of personal data and to ensure the free exchange of personal data\\nby competent authorities within the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by\\nthe Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the\\naction, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in\\naccordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the\\nTEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that\\nArticle, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to\\nachieve those objectives  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(94)\\n\\n|\\n\\nSpecific provisions of acts of the Union adopted in the field of judicial\\ncooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation which were adopted\\nprior to the date of the adoption of this Directive, regulating the processing\\nof personal data between Member States or the access of designated authorities\\nof Member States to information systems established pursuant to the Treaties,\\nshould remain unaffected, such as, for example, the specific provisions\\nconcerning the protection of personal data applied pursuant to Council\\nDecision 2008/615/JHA (12), or Article 23 of the Convention on Mutual\\nAssistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union\\n(13). Since Article 8 of the Charter and Article 16 TFEU require that the\\nfundamental right to the protection of personal data be ensured in a\\nconsistent manner throughout the Union, the Commission should evaluate the\\nsituation with regard to the relationship between this Directive and the acts\\nadopted prior to the date of adoption of this Directive regulating the\\nprocessing of personal data between Member States or the access of designated\\nauthorities of Member States to information systems established pursuant to\\nthe Treaties, in order to assess the need for alignment of those specific\\nprovisions with this Directive. Where appropriate, the Commission should make\\nproposals with a view to ensuring consistent legal rules relating to the\\nprocessing of personal data.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(95)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn order to ensure a comprehensive and consistent protection of personal data\\nin the Union, international agreements which were concluded by Member States\\nprior to the date of entry into force of this Directive and which comply with\\nthe relevant Union law applicable prior to that date should remain in force\\nuntil amended, replaced or revoked.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(96)\\n\\n|\\n\\nMember States should be allowed a period of not more than two years from the\\ndate of entry into force of this Directive to transpose it. Processing already\\nunder way on that date should be brought into conformity with this Directive\\nwithin the period of two years after which this Directive enters into force.\\nHowever, where such processing complies with the Union law applicable prior to\\nthe date of entry into force of this Directive, the requirements of this\\nDirective concerning the prior consultation of the supervisory authority\\nshould not apply to the processing operations already under way on that date\\ngiven that those requirements, by their very nature, are to be met prior to\\nthe processing. Where Member States use the longer implementation period\\nexpiring seven years after the date of entry into force of this Directive for\\nmeeting the logging obligations for automated processing systems set up prior\\nto that date, the controller or the processor should have in place effective\\nmethods for demonstrating the lawfulness of the data processing, for enabling\\nself-monitoring and for ensuring data integrity and data security, such as\\nlogs or other forms of records.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(97)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThis Directive is without prejudice to the rules on combating the sexual abuse\\nand sexual exploitation of children and child pornography as laid down in\\nDirective 2011/93/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (14).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(98)\\n\\n|\\n\\nFramework Decision 2008/977/JHA should therefore be repealed.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(99)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United\\nKingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice,\\nas annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, the United Kingdom and Ireland are not\\nbound by the rules laid down in this Directive which relate to the processing\\nof personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities which fall\\nwithin the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the\\nTFEU where the United Kingdom and Ireland are not bound by the rules governing\\nthe forms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation\\nwhich require compliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article\\n16 TFEU.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(100)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn accordance with Articles 2 and 2a of Protocol No 22 on the position of\\nDenmark, as annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not bound by the\\nrules laid down in this Directive or subject to their application which relate\\nto the processing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out\\nactivities which fall within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of\\nPart Three of the TFEU. Given that this Directive builds upon the Schengen\\nacquis, under Title V of Part Three of the TFEU, Denmark, in accordance with\\nArticle 4 of that Protocol, is to decide within six months after adoption of\\nthis Directive whether it will implement it in its national law.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(101)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAs regards Iceland and Norway, this Directive constitutes a development of\\nprovisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Agreement concluded\\nby the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the\\nKingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the\\nimplementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (15).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(102)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAs regards Switzerland, this Directive constitutes a development of provisions\\nof the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Agreement between the European\\nUnion, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the\\nassociation of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application\\nand development of the Schengen acquis (16).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(103)\\n\\n|\\n\\nAs regards Liechtenstein, this Directive constitutes a development of\\nprovisions of the Schengen acquis, as provided for by the Protocol between the\\nEuropean Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the\\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of\\nLiechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European\\nCommunity and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association\\nwith the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis\\n(17).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(104)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThis Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles\\nrecognised in the Charter as enshrined in the TFEU, in particular the right to\\nrespect for private and family life, the right to the protection of personal\\ndata, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. Limitations placed\\non those rights are in accordance with Article 52(1) of the Charter as they\\nare necessary to meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union\\nor the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(105)\\n\\n|\\n\\nIn accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of\\nMember States and the Commission on explanatory documents, Member States have\\nundertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their\\ntransposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship\\nbetween the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national\\ntransposition measures.

Processing by the same or another controller for any of the purposes set\\nout in Article 1(1) other than that for which the personal data are collected\\nshall be permitted in so far as:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe controller is authorised to process such personal data for such a purpose\\nin accordance with Union or Member State law; and  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\nprocessing is necessary and proportionate to that other purpose in accordance\\nwith Union or Member State law.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n3\\\\. Processing by the same or another controller may include archiving in the\\npublic interest, scientific, statistical or historical use, for the purposes\\nset out in Article 1(1), subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and\\nfreedoms of data subjects.\\n\\n4\\\\. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate\\ncompliance with, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.\\n\\nArticle 5\\n\\nTime-limits for storage and review\\n\\nMember States shall provide for appropriate time limits to be established for\\nthe erasure of personal data or for a periodic review of the need for the\\nstorage of personal data. Procedural measures shall ensure that those time\\nlimits are observed.\\n\\nArticle 6\\n\\nDistinction between different categories of data subject\\n\\nMember States shall provide for the controller, where applicable and as far as\\npossible, to make a clear distinction between personal data of different\\ncategories of data subjects, such as:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\npersons with regard to whom there are serious grounds for believing that they\\nhave committed or are about to commit a criminal offence;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\npersons convicted of a criminal offence;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(c)\\n\\n|\\n\\nvictims of a criminal offence or persons with regard to whom certain facts\\ngive rise to reasons for believing that he or she could be the victim of a\\ncriminal offence; and  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(d)\\n\\n|\\n\\nother parties to a criminal offence, such as persons who might be called on to\\ntestify in investigations in connection with criminal offences or subsequent\\ncriminal proceedings, persons who can provide information on criminal\\noffences, or contacts or associates of one of the persons referred to in\\npoints (a) and (b).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\nArticle 7\\n\\nDistinction between personal data and verification of quality of personal data\\n\\n1\\\\. Member States shall provide for personal data based on facts to be\\ndistinguished, as far as possible, from personal data based on personal\\nassessments.\\n\\n2\\\\. Member States shall provide for the competent authorities to take all\\nreasonable steps to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate, incomplete\\nor no longer up to date are not transmitted or made available. To that end,\\neach competent authority shall, as far as practicable, verify the quality of\\npersonal data before they are transmitted or made available.

In respect of automated processing, each Member State shall provide for\\nthe controller or processor, following an evaluation of the risks, to\\nimplement measures designed to:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\ndeny unauthorised persons access to processing equipment used for processing\\n(‘equipment access control’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\nprevent the unauthorised reading, copying, modification or removal of data\\nmedia (‘data media control’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(c)\\n\\n|\\n\\nprevent the unauthorised input of personal data and the unauthorised\\ninspection, modification or deletion of stored personal data (‘storage\\ncontrol’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(d)\\n\\n|\\n\\nprevent the use of automated processing systems by unauthorised persons using\\ndata communication equipment (‘user control’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(e)\\n\\n|\\n\\nensure that persons authorised to use an automated processing system have\\naccess only to the personal data covered by their access authorisation (‘data\\naccess control’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(f)\\n\\n|\\n\\nensure that it is possible to verify and establish the bodies to which\\npersonal data have been or may be transmitted or made available using data\\ncommunication equipment (‘communication control’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(g)\\n\\n|\\n\\nensure that it is subsequently possible to verify and establish which personal\\ndata have been input into automated processing systems and when and by whom\\nthe personal data were input (‘input control’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(h)\\n\\n|\\n\\nprevent the unauthorised reading, copying, modification or deletion of\\npersonal data during transfers of personal data or during transportation of\\ndata media (‘transport control’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(i)\\n\\n|\\n\\nensure that installed systems may, in the case of interruption, be restored\\n(‘recovery’);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(j)\\n\\n|\\n\\nensure that the functions of the system perform, that the appearance of faults\\nin the functions is reported (‘reliability’) and that stored personal data\\ncannot be corrupted by means of a malfunctioning of the system (‘integrity’).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\nArticle 30\\n\\nNotification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority\\n\\n1\\\\. Member States shall, in the case of a personal data breach, provide for\\nthe controller to notify without undue delay and, where feasible, not later\\nthan 72 hours after having become aware of it, the personal data breach to the\\nsupervisory authority, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result\\nin a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the\\nnotification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it\\nshall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.\\n\\n2\\\\. The processor shall notify the controller without undue delay after\\nbecoming aware of a personal data breach.\\n\\n3\\\\. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\ndescribe the nature of the personal data breach including, where possible, the\\ncategories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the\\ncategories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\ncommunicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or\\nother contact point where more information can be obtained;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(c)\\n\\n|\\n\\ndescribe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(d)\\n\\n|\\n\\ndescribe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to\\naddress the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to\\nmitigate its possible adverse effects.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n4\\\\.

In such a case, there shall\\ninstead be a public communication or a similar measure whereby the data\\nsubjects are informed in an equally effective manner.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n4\\\\. If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to\\nthe data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood\\nof the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so,\\nor may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.\\n\\n5\\\\. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this\\nArticle may be delayed, restricted or omitted subject to the conditions and on\\nthe grounds referred to in Article 13(3).\\n\\nSection 3\\n\\nData protection officer\\n\\nArticle 32\\n\\nDesignation of the data protection officer\\n\\n1\\\\.

Member States shall provide for any transfer by competent authorities of\\npersonal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing\\nafter transfer to a third country or to an international organisation\\nincluding for onward transfers to another third country or international\\norganisation to take place, subject to compliance with the national provisions\\nadopted pursuant to other provisions of this Directive, only where the\\nconditions laid down in this Chapter are met, namely:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe transfer is necessary for the purposes set out in Article 1(1);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe personal data are transferred to a controller in a third country or\\ninternational organisation that is an authority competent for the purposes\\nreferred to in Article 1(1);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(c)\\n\\n|\\n\\nwhere personal data are transmitted or made available from another Member\\nState, that Member State has given its prior authorisation to the transfer in\\naccordance with its national law;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(d)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe Commission has adopted an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 36, or, in\\nthe absence of such a decision, appropriate safeguards have been provided or\\nexist pursuant to Article 37, or, in the absence of an adequacy decision\\npursuant to Article 36 and of appropriate safeguards in accordance with\\nArticle 37, derogations for specific situations apply pursuant to Article 38;\\nand  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(e)\\n\\n|\\n\\nin the case of an onward transfer to another third country or international\\norganisation, the competent authority that carried out the original transfer\\nor another competent authority of the same Member State authorises the onward\\ntransfer, after taking into due account all relevant factors, including the\\nseriousness of the criminal offence, the purpose for which the personal data\\nwas originally transferred and the level of personal data protection in the\\nthird country or an international organisation to which personal data are\\nonward transferred.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n2\\\\. Member States shall provide for transfers without the prior authorisation\\nby another Member State in accordance with point (c) of paragraph 1 to be\\npermitted only if the transfer of the personal data is necessary for the\\nprevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security of a Member\\nState or a third country or to essential interests of a Member State and the\\nprior authorisation cannot be obtained in good time. The authority responsible\\nfor giving prior authorisation shall be informed without delay.\\n\\n3\\\\. All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that\\nthe level of protection of natural persons ensured by this Directive is not\\nundermined.\\n\\nArticle 36\\n\\nTransfers on the basis of an adequacy decision\\n\\n1\\\\. Member States shall provide that a transfer of personal data to a third\\ncountry or an international organisation may take place where the Commission\\nhas decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified\\nsectors within that third country, or the international organisation in\\nquestion ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not\\nrequire any specific authorisation.\\n\\n2\\\\. When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, the Commission\\nshall, in particular, take account of the following elements:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant\\nlegislation, both general and sectoral, including concerning public security,\\ndefence, national security and criminal law and the access of public\\nauthorities to personal data, as well as the implementation of such\\nlegislation, data protection rules, professional rules and security measures,\\nincluding rules for the onward transfer of personal data to another third\\ncountry or international organisation, which are complied with in that country\\nor international organisation, case-law, as well as effective and enforceable\\ndata subject rights and effective administrative and judicial redress for the\\ndata subjects whose personal data are transferred;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory\\nauthorities in the third country or to which an international organisation is\\nsubject, with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with data\\nprotection rules, including adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and\\nadvising data subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the\\nsupervisory authorities of the Member States; and  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(c)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe international commitments the third country or international organisation\\nconcerned has entered into, or other obligations arising from legally binding\\nconventions or instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral\\nor regional systems, in particular in relation to the protection of personal\\ndata.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n3\\\\. The Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of protection,\\nmay decide, by means of implementing act, that a third country, a territory or\\none or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international\\norganisation ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of\\nparagraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall provide a mechanism\\nfor periodic review, at least every four years, which shall take into account\\nall relevant developments in the third country or international organisation.\\nThe implementing act shall specify its territorial and sectoral application\\nand, where applicable, identify the supervisory authority or authorities\\nreferred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act\\nshall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in\\nArticle 58(2).\\n\\n4\\\\. The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis, monitor developments in third\\ncountries and international organisations that could affect the functioning of\\ndecisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 3.\\n\\n5\\\\. The Commission shall, where available information reveals, in particular\\nfollowing the review referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, that a third\\ncountry, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third country,\\nor an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of\\nprotection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article, to the extent\\nnecessary, repeal, amend or suspend the decision referred to in paragraph 3 of\\nthis Article by means of implementing acts without retro-active effect. Those\\nimplementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination\\nprocedure referred to in Article 58(2).\\n\\nOn duly justified imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission shall adopt\\nimmediately applicable implementing acts in accordance with the procedure\\nreferred to in Article 58(3).\\n\\n6\\\\. The Commission shall enter into consultations with the third country or\\ninternational organisation with a view to remedying the situation giving rise\\nto the decision made pursuant to paragraph 5.\\n\\n7\\\\. Member States shall provide for a decision pursuant to paragraph 5 to be\\nwithout prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, the\\nterritory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the\\ninternational organisation in question pursuant to Articles 37 and 38.\\n\\n8\\\\. The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union\\nand on its website a list of the third countries, territories and specified\\nsectors within a third country and international organisations for which it\\nhas decided that an adequate level of protection is or is no longer ensured.\\n\\nArticle 37\\n\\nTransfers subject to appropriate safeguards\\n\\n1\\\\. In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 36(3), Member States\\nshall provide that a transfer of personal data to a third country or an\\ninternational organisation may take place where:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\nappropriate safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data are\\nprovided for in a legally binding instrument; or  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the transfer of\\npersonal data and concludes that appropriate safeguards exist with regard to\\nthe protection of personal data.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n2\\\\. The controller shall inform the supervisory authority about categories of\\ntransfers under point (b) of paragraph 1.\\n\\n3\\\\. When a transfer is based on point (b) of paragraph 1, such a transfer\\nshall be documented and the documentation shall be made available to the\\nsupervisory authority on request, including the date and time of the transfer,\\ninformation about the receiving competent authority, the justification for the\\ntransfer and the personal data transferred.\\n\\nArticle 38\\n\\nDerogations for specific situations\\n\\n1\\\\. In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 36, or of\\nappropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 37, Member States shall provide\\nthat a transfer or a category of transfers of personal data to a third country\\nor an international organisation may take place only on the condition that the\\ntransfer is necessary:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\nin order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\nto safeguard legitimate interests of the data subject, where the law of the\\nMember State transferring the personal data so provides;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(c)\\n\\n|\\n\\nfor the prevention of an immediate and serious threat to public security of a\\nMember State or a third country;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(d)\\n\\n|\\n\\nin individual cases for the purposes set out in Article 1(1); or  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(e)\\n\\n|\\n\\nin an individual case for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal\\nclaims relating to the purposes set out in Article 1(1).  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n2\\\\. Personal data shall not be transferred if the transferring competent\\nauthority determines that fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject\\nconcerned override the public interest in the transfer set out in points (d)\\nand (e) of paragraph 1.\\n\\n3\\\\. Where a transfer is based on paragraph 1, such a transfer shall be\\ndocumented and the documentation shall be made available to the supervisory\\nauthority on request, including the date and time of the transfer, information\\nabout the receiving competent authority, the justification for the transfer\\nand the personal data transferred.\\n\\nArticle 39\\n\\nTransfers of personal data to recipients established in third countries\\n\\n1\\\\. By way of derogation from point (b) of Article 35(1) and without prejudice\\nto any international agreement referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article,\\nUnion or Member State law may provide for the competent authorities referred\\nto in point (7)(a) of Article 3, in individual and specific cases, to transfer\\npersonal data directly to recipients established in third countries only if\\nthe other provisions of this Directive are complied with and all of the\\nfollowing conditions are fulfilled:\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe transfer is strictly necessary for the performance of a task of the\\ntransferring competent authority as provided for by Union or Member State law\\nfor the purposes set out in Article 1(1);  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(b)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe transferring competent authority determines that no fundamental rights and\\nfreedoms of the data subject concerned override the public interest\\nnecessitating the transfer in the case at hand;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(c)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe transferring competent authority considers that the transfer to an\\nauthority that is competent for the purposes referred to in Article 1(1) in\\nthe third country is ineffective or inappropriate, in particular because the\\ntransfer cannot be achieved in good time;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(d)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe authority that is competent for the purposes referred to in Article 1(1)\\nin the third country is informed without undue delay, unless this is\\nineffective or inappropriate;  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(e)\\n\\n|\\n\\nthe transferring competent authority informs the recipient of the specified\\npurpose or purposes for which the personal data are only to be processed by\\nthe latter provided that such processing is necessary.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n2\\\\.

National Standard of Canada\\nEntitled Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information,\\nCAN/CSA-Q830-96  \\n\\n## 4.1 Principle 1 â\\x80\\x94 Accountability\\n\\nAn organization is responsible for personal information under its control and\\nshall designate an individual or individuals who are accountable for the\\norganizationâ\\x80\\x99s compliance with the following principles.\\n\\n **4.1.1**\\n\\nAccountability for the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s compliance with the principles rests\\nwith the designated individual(s), even though other individuals within the\\norganization may be responsible for the day-to-day collection and processing\\nof personal information. In addition, other individuals within the\\norganization may be delegated to act on behalf of the designated\\nindividual(s).\\n\\n **4.1.2**\\n\\nThe identity of the individual(s) designated by the organization to oversee\\nthe organizationâ\\x80\\x99s compliance with the principles shall be made known upon\\nrequest.\\n\\n **4.1.3**\\n\\nAn organization is responsible for personal information in its possession or\\ncustody, including information that has been transferred to a third party for\\nprocessing. The organization shall use contractual or other means to provide a\\ncomparable level of protection while the information is being processed by a\\nthird party.\\n\\n **4.1.4**\\n\\nOrganizations shall implement policies and practices to give effect to the\\nprinciples, including\\n\\n  * (a)Â implementing procedures to protect personal information;\\n\\n  * (b)Â establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries;\\n\\n  * (c)Â training staff and communicating to staff information about the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s policies and practices; and\\n\\n  * (d)Â developing information to explain the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s policies and procedures.\\n\\n## 4.2 Principle 2 â\\x80\\x94 Identifying Purposes\\n\\nThe purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified\\nby the organization at or before the time the information is collected.\\n\\n **4.2.1**\\n\\nThe organization shall document the purposes for which personal information is\\ncollected in order to comply with the Openness principle (ClauseÂ 4.8) and the\\nIndividual Access principle (ClauseÂ 4.9).\\n\\n **4.2.2**\\n\\nIdentifying the purposes for which personal information is collected at or\\nbefore the time of collection allows organizations to determine the\\ninformation they need to collect to fulfil these purposes. The Limiting\\nCollection principle (ClauseÂ 4.4) requires an organization to collect only\\nthat information necessary for the purposes that have been identified.\\n\\n **4.2.3**\\n\\nThe identified purposes should be specified at or before the time of\\ncollection to the individual from whom the personal information is collected.\\nDepending upon the way in which the information is collected, this can be done\\norally or in writing. An application form, for example, may give notice of the\\npurposes.\\n\\n **4.2.4**\\n\\nWhen personal information that has been collected is to be used for a purpose\\nnot previously identified, the new purpose shall be identified prior to use.\\nUnless the new purpose is required by law, the consent of the individual is\\nrequired before information can be used for that purpose. For an elaboration\\non consent, please refer to the Consent principle (ClauseÂ 4.3).\\n\\n **4.2.5**\\n\\nPersons collecting personal information should be able to explain to\\nindividuals the purposes for which the information is being collected.\\n\\n **4.2.6**\\n\\nThis principle is linked closely to the Limiting Collection principle (Clause\\n4.4) and the Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention principle (ClauseÂ 4.5).\\n\\n## 4.3 Principle 3 - Consent\\n\\nThe knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection,\\nuse, or disclosure of personal information, except where inappropriate.\\n\\nNote: In certain circumstances personal information can be collected, used, or\\ndisclosed without the knowledge and consent of the individual. For example,\\nlegal, medical, or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to\\nseek consent. When information is being collected for the detection and\\nprevention of fraud or for law enforcement, seeking the consent of the\\nindividual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information. Seeking\\nconsent may be impossible or inappropriate when the individual is a minor,\\nseriously ill, or mentally incapacitated. In addition, organizations that do\\nnot have a direct relationship with the individual may not always be able to\\nseek consent. For example, seeking consent may be impractical for a charity or\\na direct-marketing firm that wishes to acquire a mailing list from another\\norganization. In such cases, the organization providing the list would be\\nexpected to obtain consent before disclosing personal information.\\n\\n **4.3.1**\\n\\nConsent is required for the collection of personal information and the\\nsubsequent use or disclosure of this information. Typically, an organization\\nwill seek consent for the use or disclosure of the information at the time of\\ncollection. In certain circumstances, consent with respect to use or\\ndisclosure may be sought after the information has been collected but before\\nuse (for example, when an organization wants to use information for a purpose\\nnot previously identified).\\n\\n **4.3.2**\\n\\nThe principle requires â\\x80\\x9cknowledge and consentâ\\x80\\x9d. Organizations shall make a\\nreasonable effort to ensure that the individual is advised of the purposes for\\nwhich the information will be used. To make the consent meaningful, the\\npurposes must be stated in such a manner that the individual can reasonably\\nunderstand how the information will be used or disclosed.\\n\\n **4.3.3**\\n\\nAn organization shall not, as a condition of the supply of a product or\\nservice, require an individual to consent to the collection, use, or\\ndisclosure of information beyond that required to fulfil the explicitly\\nspecified, and legitimate purposes.\\n\\n **4.3.4**\\n\\nThe form of the consent sought by the organization may vary, depending upon\\nthe circumstances and the type of information. In determining the form of\\nconsent to use, organizations shall take into account the sensitivity of the\\ninformation. Although some information (for example, medical records and\\nincome records) is almost always considered to be sensitive, any information\\ncan be sensitive, depending on the context. For example, the names and\\naddresses of subscribers to a newsmagazine would generally not be considered\\nsensitive information. However, the names and addresses of subscribers to some\\nspecial-interest magazines might be considered sensitive.\\n\\n **4.3.5**\\n\\nIn obtaining consent, the reasonable expectations of the individual are also\\nrelevant. For example, an individual buying a subscription to a magazine\\nshould reasonably expect that the organization, in addition to using the\\nindividualâ\\x80\\x99s name and address for mailing and billing purposes, would also\\ncontact the person to solicit the renewal of the subscription. In this case,\\nthe organization can assume that the individualâ\\x80\\x99s request constitutes\\nconsent for specific purposes. On the other hand, an individual would not\\nreasonably expect that personal information given to a health-care\\nprofessional would be given to a company selling health-care products, unless\\nconsent were obtained. Consent shall not be obtained through deception.\\n\\n **4.3.6**\\n\\nThe way in which an organization seeks consent may vary, depending on the\\ncircumstances and the type of information collected. An organization should\\ngenerally seek express consent when the information is likely to be considered\\nsensitive. Implied consent would generally be appropriate when the information\\nis less sensitive. Consent can also be given by an authorized representative\\n(such as a legal guardian or a person having power of attorney).\\n\\n **4.3.7**\\n\\nIndividuals can give consent in many ways. For example:\\n\\n  * (a)Â an application form may be used to seek consent, collect information, and inform the individual of the use that will be made of the information. By completing and signing the form, the individual is giving consent to the collection and the specified uses;\\n\\n  * (b)Â a checkoff box may be used to allow individuals to request that their names and addresses not be given to other organizations. Individuals who do not check the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of this information to third parties;\\n\\n  * (c)Â consent may be given orally when information is collected over the telephone; or\\n\\n  * (d)Â consent may be given at the time that individuals use a product or service.\\n\\n **4.3.8**\\n\\nAn individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or\\ncontractual restrictions and reasonable notice. The organization shall inform\\nthe individual of the implications of such withdrawal.\\n\\n## 4.4 Principle 4 â\\x80\\x94 Limiting Collection\\n\\nThe collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is\\nnecessary for the purposes identified by the organization. Information shall\\nbe collected by fair and lawful means.\\n\\n **4.4.1**\\n\\nOrganizations shall not collect personal information indiscriminately. Both\\nthe amount and the type of information collected shall be limited to that\\nwhich is necessary to fulfil the purposes identified. Organizations shall\\nspecify the type of information collected as part of their information-\\nhandling policies and practices, in accordance with the Openness principle\\n(ClauseÂ 4.8).\\n\\n **4.4.2**\\n\\nThe requirement that personal information be collected by fair and lawful\\nmeans is intended to prevent organizations from collecting information by\\nmisleading or deceiving individuals about the purpose for which information is\\nbeing collected. This requirement implies that consent with respect to\\ncollection must not be obtained through deception.\\n\\n **4.4.3**\\n\\nThis principle is linked closely to the Identifying Purposes principle\\n(ClauseÂ 4.2) and the Consent principle (Clause 4.3).\\n\\n## 4.5 Principle 5 â\\x80\\x94Limiting Use, Disclosure, and Retention\\n\\nPersonal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than\\nthose for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or\\nas required by law. Personal information shall be retained only as long as\\nnecessary for the fulfilment of those purposes.\\n\\n **4.5.1**\\n\\nOrganizations using personal information for a new purpose shall document this\\npurpose (see ClauseÂ 4.2.1).\\n\\n **4.5.2**\\n\\nOrganizations should develop guidelines and implement procedures with respect\\nto the retention of personal information. These guidelines should include\\nminimum and maximum retention periods. Personal information that has been used\\nto make a decision about an individual shall be retained long enough to allow\\nthe individual access to the information after the decision has been made. An\\norganization may be subject to legislative requirements with respect to\\nretention periods.\\n\\n **4.5.3**\\n\\nPersonal information that is no longer required to fulfil the identified\\npurposes should be destroyed, erased, or made anonymous. Organizations shall\\ndevelop guidelines and implement procedures to govern the destruction of\\npersonal information.\\n\\n **4.5.4**\\n\\nThis principle is closely linked to the Consent principle (ClauseÂ 4.3), the\\nIdentifying Purposes principle (ClauseÂ 4.2), and the Individual Access\\nprinciple (ClauseÂ 4.9).\\n\\n## 4.6 Principle 6 â\\x80\\x94 Accuracy\\n\\nPersonal information shall be as accurate, complete, and up-to-date as is\\nnecessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.\\n\\n **4.6.1**\\n\\nThe extent to which personal information shall be accurate, complete, and up-\\nto-date will depend upon the use of the information, taking into account the\\ninterests of the individual. Information shall be sufficiently accurate,\\ncomplete, and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate\\ninformation may be used to make a decision about the individual.\\n\\n **4.6.2**\\n\\nAn organization shall not routinely update personal information, unless such a\\nprocess is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was\\ncollected.\\n\\n **4.6.3**\\n\\nPersonal information that is used on an ongoing basis, including information\\nthat is disclosed to third parties, should generally be accurate and up-to-\\ndate, unless limits to the requirement for accuracy are clearly set out.\\n\\n## 4.7 Principle 7 â\\x80\\x94 Safeguards\\n\\nPersonal information shall be protected by security safeguards appropriate to\\nthe sensitivity of the information.\\n\\n **4.7.1**\\n\\nThe security safeguards shall protect personal information against loss or\\ntheft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or\\nmodification. Organizations shall protect personal information regardless of\\nthe format in which it is held.\\n\\n **4.7.2**\\n\\nThe nature of the safeguards will vary depending on the sensitivity of the\\ninformation that has been collected, the amount, distribution, and format of\\nthe information, and the method of storage. More sensitive information should\\nbe safeguarded by a higher level of protection. The concept of sensitivity is\\ndiscussed in ClauseÂ 4.3.4.\\n\\n **4.7.3**\\n\\nThe methods of protection should include\\n\\n  * (a)Â physical measures, for example, locked filing cabinets and restricted access to offices;\\n\\n  * (b)Â organizational measures, for example, security clearances and limiting access on a â\\x80\\x9cneed-to-knowâ\\x80\\x9d basis; and\\n\\n  * (c)Â technological measures, for example, the use of passwords and encryption.\\n\\n **4.7.4**\\n\\nOrganizations shall make their employees aware of the importance of\\nmaintaining the confidentiality of personal information.\\n\\n **4.7.5**\\n\\nCare shall be used in the disposal or destruction of personal information, to\\nprevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information (see\\nClauseÂ 4.5.3).\\n\\n## 4.8 Principle 8 â\\x80\\x94 Openness\\n\\nAn organization shall make readily available to individuals specific\\ninformation about its policies and practices relating to the management of\\npersonal information.\\n\\n **4.8.1**\\n\\nOrganizations shall be open about their policies and practices with respect to\\nthe management of personal information. Individuals shall be able to acquire\\ninformation about an organizationâ\\x80\\x99s policies and practices without\\nunreasonable effort. This information shall be made available in a form that\\nis generally understandable.\\n\\n **4.8.2**\\n\\nThe information made available shall include\\n\\n  * (a)Â the name or title, and the address, of the person who is accountable for the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s policies and practices and to whom complaints or inquiries can be forwarded;\\n\\n  * (b)Â the means of gaining access to personal information held by the organization;\\n\\n  * (c)Â a description of the type of personal information held by the organization, including a general account of its use;\\n\\n  * (d)Â a copy of any brochures or other information that explain the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s policies, standards, or codes; and\\n\\n  * (e)Â what personal information is made available to related organizations (e.g., subsidiaries).\\n\\n **4.8.3**\\n\\nAn organization may make information on its policies and practices available\\nin a variety of ways. The method chosen depends on the nature of its business\\nand other considerations. For example, an organization may choose to make\\nbrochures available in its place of business, mail information to its\\ncustomers, provide online access, or establish a toll-free telephone number.\\n\\n## 4.9 Principle 9 â\\x80\\x94 Individual Access\\n\\nUpon request, an individual shall be informed of the existence, use, and\\ndisclosure of his or her personal information and shall be given access to\\nthat information. An individual shall be able to challenge the accuracy and\\ncompleteness of the information and have it amended as appropriate.\\n\\nNote: In certain situations, an organization may not be able to provide access\\nto all the personal information it holds about an individual. Exceptions to\\nthe access requirement should be limited and specific. The reasons for denying\\naccess should be provided to the individual upon request. Exceptions may\\ninclude information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that\\ncontains references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed\\nfor legal, security, or commercial proprietary reasons, and information that\\nis subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege.\\n\\n **4.9.1**\\n\\nUpon request, an organization shall inform an individual whether or not the\\norganization holds personal information about the individual. Organizations\\nare encouraged to indicate the source of this information. The organization\\nshall allow the individual access to this information. However, the\\norganization may choose to make sensitive medical information available\\nthrough a medical practitioner. In addition, the organization shall provide an\\naccount of the use that has been made or is being made of this information and\\nan account of the third parties to which it has been disclosed.\\n\\n **4.9.2**\\n\\nAn individual may be required to provide sufficient information to permit an\\norganization to provide an account of the existence, use, and disclosure of\\npersonal information. The information provided shall only be used for this\\npurpose.\\n\\n **4.9.3**\\n\\nIn providing an account of third parties to which it has disclosed personal\\ninformation about an individual, an organization should attempt to be as\\nspecific as possible. When it is not possible to provide a list of the\\norganizations to which it has actually disclosed information about an\\nindividual, the organization shall provide a list of organizations to which it\\nmay have disclosed information about the individual.\\n\\n **4.9.4**\\n\\nAn organization shall respond to an individualâ\\x80\\x99s request within a reasonable\\ntime and at minimal or no cost to the individual. The requested information\\nshall be provided or made available in a form that is generally\\nunderstandable. For example, if the organization uses abbreviations or codes\\nto record information, an explanation shall be provided.\\n\\n **4.9.5**\\n\\nWhen an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness\\nof personal information, the organization shall amend the information as\\nrequired. Depending upon the nature of the information challenged, amendment\\ninvolves the correction, deletion, or addition of information. Where\\nappropriate, the amended information shall be transmitted to third parties\\nhaving access to the information in question.\\n\\n **4.9.6**\\n\\nWhen a challenge is not resolved to the satisfaction of the individual, the\\nsubstance of the unresolved challenge shall be recorded by the organization.\\nWhen appropriate, the existence of the unresolved challenge shall be\\ntransmitted to third parties having access to the information in question.\\n\\n## 4.10 Principle 10 â\\x80\\x94 Challenging Compliance\\n\\nAn individual shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance with\\nthe above principles to the designated individual or individuals accountable\\nfor the organizationâ\\x80\\x99s compliance.\\n\\n **4.10.1**\\n\\nThe individual accountable for an organizationâ\\x80\\x99s compliance is discussed in\\nClauseÂ 4.1.1.\\n\\n **4.10.2**\\n\\nOrganizations shall put procedures in place to receive and respond to\\ncomplaints or inquiries about their policies and practices relating to the\\nhandling of personal information. The complaint procedures should be easily\\naccessible and simple to use.\\n\\n **4.10.3**\\n\\nOrganizations shall inform individuals who make inquiries or lodge complaints\\nof the existence of relevant complaint procedures.

Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights\\nof the European Union (‘the Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the\\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right\\nto the protection of personal data concerning him or her.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(2)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard\\nto the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or\\nresidence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their\\nright to the protection of personal data.

The scale of the collection and sharing\\nof personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows personal data\\nto be processed on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue activities such\\nas the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal\\noffences or the execution of criminal penalties.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(4)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe free flow of personal data between competent authorities for the purposes\\nof the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal\\noffences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding\\nagainst and the prevention of threats to public security within the Union and\\nthe transfer of such personal data to third countries and international\\norganisations, should be facilitated while ensuring a high level of protection\\nof personal data. Those developments require the building of a strong and more\\ncoherent framework for the protection of personal data in the Union, backed by\\nstrong enforcement.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(5)\\n\\n|\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) applies\\nto all processing of personal data in Member States in both the public and the\\nprivate sectors.
