Article 8(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights\\nof the European Union (‘the Charter’) and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the\\nFunctioning of the European Union (TFEU) provide that everyone has the right\\nto the protection of personal data concerning him or her.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(2)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe principles of, and rules on the protection of natural persons with regard\\nto the processing of their personal data should, whatever their nationality or\\nresidence, respect their fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular their\\nright to the protection of personal data. This Directive is intended to\\ncontribute to the accomplishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(3)\\n\\n|\\n\\nRapid technological developments and globalisation have brought new challenges\\nfor the protection of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing\\nof personal data has increased significantly. Technology allows personal data\\nto be processed on an unprecedented scale in order to pursue activities such\\nas the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal\\noffences or the execution of criminal penalties.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(4)\\n\\n|\\n\\nThe free flow of personal data between competent authorities for the purposes\\nof the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal\\noffences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding\\nagainst and the prevention of threats to public security within the Union and\\nthe transfer of such personal data to third countries and international\\norganisations, should be facilitated while ensuring a high level of protection\\nof personal data. Those developments require the building of a strong and more\\ncoherent framework for the protection of personal data in the Union, backed by\\nstrong enforcement.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(5)\\n\\n|\\n\\nDirective 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) applies\\nto all processing of personal data in Member States in both the public and the\\nprivate sectors. However, it does not apply to the processing of personal data\\nin the course of an activity which falls outside the scope of Community law,\\nsuch as activities in the areas of judicial cooperation in criminal matters\\nand police cooperation.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(6)\\n\\n|\\n\\nCouncil Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (4) applies in the areas of judicial\\ncooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. The scope of\\napplication of that Framework Decision is limited to the processing of\\npersonal data transmitted or made available between Member States.  \\n  \\n---|---  \\n  \\n(7)\\n\\n|\\n\\nEnsuring a consistent and high level of protection of the personal data of\\nnatural persons and facilitating the exchange of personal data between\\ncompetent authorities of Members States is crucial in order to ensure\\neffective judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. To\\nthat end, the level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural\\npersons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent\\nauthorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or\\nprosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,\\nincluding the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public\\nsecurity, should be equivalent in all Member States.
